    <h1>MiTraveler 7D-1A Review</h1>

    <h2>General Specifications</h2>
    <p>The MiTraveler 7D-1A is an Android tablet, running Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich).</p>
    <p>The tablet sports an AllWinner Boxchip A13, clocked at 1.00 GHz (Gigahertz).</p>
    <p>It has a 0.3-megapixel camera for video calling. Although I don't think it's that great. It renders max in VGA anyway.</p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>The performance depends on what you download on it and use the tablet for. Me? I use it to check my email.</p>
    <p>Checking my email doesn't take that much RAM, especially due to the tablet only having 512 megabytes of it.</p>
    <b>You could try and find AllWinner A13 custom kernels, but I doubt there'd be anything because of the obscurity of the device.</b>

    <h2>Touchscreen</h2>
    <p>The tablet has a 7 inch touchscreen, 5 points. You can test this in a touchscreen test app.</p>
    <p>I do find it needs a little bit more pressure than usual, but I might just be skinny.</p>

    <h2>Display</h2>
    <p>The display isn't that great of a display. It's an 800x480 display with <i>(I estimate...)</i> 16 million colors.</p>
    <p>It's clocked at 60 Hz aswell.</p>
    <p>The display is fine for reading ebooks and emails, along with basic games such as Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Even for low expectations, the storage is disappointing. It's only 8 gigabytes. So beware of storage runouts, or just buy a 32GB MicroSD Card.</p>
    <p>But it's good enough storage for writing small documents. DEFINITELY DON'T TRY MAKING PROGRAMS ON THIS.</p>

    <h2>Speaker</h2>
    <p>The speaker is definitely not an all-winner (hah, see what I did there?), but it does have a 3.5mm headphone jack. So you can connect external ear/headphones.</p>
    <p>But, its quiet enough to use in the middle of the night so you dont wake up your parents. Heheh.</p>

    <h2>Battery Life</h2>
    <p>Battery life unfortunately doesn't do a justice. At a whopping 1-2 hours of battery life, you'll mostly be having this handset plugged in at all times.</p>
    <p>Sad to say; pretty much <b>no</b> redeeming qualities of the battery life.</p>
    <h2>Finally, the Physical Design</h2>
    <p>All around the tablet is made of cheap material. Although there are redeeming qualities such as a plastic, textured grip along the faux-wooden rear end.</p>
    <p>The screen is made of plastic though so don't drop it lol</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the MiTraveler is an entry-level device, with very low specifications.</p>
    <p>So if you want something cheap and low end to check your email on or play very light games, this is the device for you.</p>
